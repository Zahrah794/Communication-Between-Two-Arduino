# Communication-Between-Two-Arduino


## Description
The concept behind the circuit is to establish a communication mechanism between two Arduino Uno boards, facilitating the exchange of signals and enabling a button-LED interaction. By connecting a button to one Arduino and an LED to the other, the circuit allows for the transmission of a control signal from the button Arduino to the LED Arduino. Thus, when the button is pressed, it triggers a signal that instructs the LED Arduino to illuminate the connected LED. This setup showcases the fundamental principles of intercommunication and control between Arduino devices, providing a practical demonstration of their capabilities.
